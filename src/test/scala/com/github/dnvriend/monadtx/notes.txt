  // as you are here, I am going to assume that you know what monad transformers are for,
  // but in case you don't:

  // The article above states that 'monad transformers' allow us to stack monads, but what does that mean?
  // Well, basically it means that you can wrap/nest one monad inside another for example, using the standard Scala library:
  // Option[Option[A]] would be a 'stack of monads', of a Future[Option[A]] or a String \/ Option[A], List[Option[A]], and so on.

  // The problem monad transformers fix for us is giving us a simple and easy way (convenient), to work with this
  // nested structure of monads without needing to inline-unwrap the nested monad.

  // To effectively use Monad Transformers, we need three things:
  // 1. Type Definitions
  // 2. A way to construct values of these new types we defined
  // 3. The removal of one layer of nesting when we use the monad

  // For example, to use the 'OptionT' monad transformer, it has the following type:
  // OptionT[M[_], A] which means that it is a monad transformer that constructs an Option[A] inside the monad 'M'.
  // So monad transformers are build from the inside-out.
  //

  // 1. defining types

  // We have just defined two types (aliases) for the monad we wrap around the Option. This is needed
  // because of type-inference. OptionT expects M to have (one) kind (type), which is M[_], and that is a single parameter,
  // but the Disjunction (\/) has two type parameters. By using a type-alias we can get from two parameters to one.

  // 2. construct values of the defined types
  //  val result: Result[Int] = 42.point[Result]
